# Guidelines
Our goal is to answer 1 simple question, What is this item for?

Item descriptions need to be fast, to the point, and useful.

Descriptions have a character limit between 50 and 60 characters depending on the size of the letters.

ALL weapons include an MSR Value (minimal strength requirement) writen as:  
`MSR: 4/7` - the 2nd number is the value with the off-hand occupied.

## Keywords

### Priorities:
1. Describe the item with best-we-can-get gamer data.
2. If description does not fit, to ensure less important part will be cut off (keep that cut in the file).
3. Fit the description, it is better to lose comma or grammar than to lose the word.
4. Flavor text for items that do not have much data.
5. Flavor should approach item from the perspective of Victorian Era citizen of neutral education (no tech specialist or mage master).
