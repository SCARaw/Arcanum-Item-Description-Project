### To apply fix to a unique variant of an item

   1. Copy the `modules` folder inside the `Arcanum root directory` (the one where Arcanum.exe is located)
   2. Copy `Jen_ApplyFix.bat` inside the Arcanum root directory as well, and launch it by double-clicking
   3. Enjoy :3

Note: If at any time, Windows asks to replace files during copy, select `yes` / `yes to all` / `replace files in this destination`.
