# Arcanum-Item-Description-Project
This is a project that aims to finish Item descriptions in Arcanum because why not?

The major goal of this mod is to go through every single item in the game and put at least a basic description if not proper game data

In the case of armors and weapons, item stats always go 1st, before any descriptors 

Otherwise flavor text is fine too (its definitely better than nothing)

As for immersion breaking text: I would say permited for quest items, but try to tie them to the character's knowledge about the quest
